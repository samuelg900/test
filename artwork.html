      <p class="body_text">Presumably commissioned in 2014 by the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT, this painting
        tells a story that many seem to struggle with; that of finding one's voice. The artist <a class="links"
          href="https://www.instagram.com/sarahcrutherford" target="_blank">Sarah C. Rutherford</a>, says she personally
        feels connected with this story as it reminds her of her own experience at UVM while being a student advocate at
        the university.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="body_text">Situated on Av. El Dorado in Bogotá, Colombia, we see a painting of an Afro-Colombian woman
        looking serene as she seems to glance down at the street below. Although this piece is one of several paintings
        on a short stretch of road, it's unclear whether the same artist created the others. Despite the surrounding artwork, this painting stands out for its simple yet impactful imagery.</p>
      <p class="body_text">The artist, who goes by <a class="links" href="https://www.instagram.com/jotados_graffiti"
          target="_blank">Jotados Graffiti</a>, says the painting is a homage to the island of San Andres and its
        "magic." San Andres is an island of Colombia in the Caribbean Sea which was once primarily inhabited by a black
        colombian ethnic group called the Raizal. While the Raizal people's population is much lower than it once used
        to be, this painting still demonstrates that their cultural roots still remain deeply embedded in the island's
        identity. The painting may also serve as a tribute to the enduring presence of their Afro-Caribbean heritage and
        the resilience of a community that continues to preserve its traditions and way of life despite unchecked
        tourism and other ongoing challenges. </p>

      <p class="body_text">“The Kiss of the Invisibles” is the title of this artwork located in Bogotá, Colombia. It was
        created by <a class="links" href="https://www.instagram.com/vertigograffiti/" target="_blank">Vértigo
          Graffiti</a> alongside a couple fellow artists. This piece was inspired by the late Héctor Fabio Zamora's 2013
        photograph “Beso del Bronx,” which captures a homeless couple embracing as they lie on the streets of the El
        Bronx neighborhood.</p>
      <p class="body_text">El Bronx was a multi-crime infested neighborhood which the government of Colombia set out to
        dismantle in 2016. With a multitude of law enforcement officers, the neighborhood was raided and cleared out in
        a massive operation that exposed rampant drug trafficking, human trafficking, and extreme poverty. This action
        marked the beginning of an urban renewal project aimed at transforming the area into a cultural and creative
        hub.</p>
      <p class="body_text">With all the chaos and violence, the couple was caught in the middle of it all portraying
        that although they were surrounded by suffering, love can not only exist but endure and prevail. Their embrace
        reminds us that, despite how often homeless individuals are dehumanized, they feel, love, and hope just like the
        rest of us.</p>

      <img class="body_pano" src="art_images/pano_colombia.jpg" alt="Australian-Colombian - Street Art" />
      <p class="body_text">On a less sorrowful note, this final art piece was created as tribute to the
        Australian-Colombian Dialogue organization which represents stronger friendships and co-operations between the
        countries with the goal of improving the world.</p>
      <p class="body_text">The artist goes by <a class="links" href="https://www.instagram.com/crispstreetart"
          target="_blank">Crisp</a>, and while they're based out of Australia, they have created various street art
        pieces around the world; which includes this one in Bogota, Colombia.</p>
